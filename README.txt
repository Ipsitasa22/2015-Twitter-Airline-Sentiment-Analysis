This was a task set forth by Dr. Brooks and the University of Michigan in their "Mentor Academy" for Data Science.
The basis behind the task was to source data and create an original problem to be sovled for furture learners.


Data contained in this repository is from Kaggle and tackles the topic of anazlying Airline sentiment from Twitter 
data. Within the Jupyter notebook, one of the cells contains tags of all methods and tools used to analyze the data.
For example, if an interested party would like to know if regular expressions were used anywhere within the Analysis,
that user can easily search the tags of particular "skills" used before parsing the code.
